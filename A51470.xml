            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. How a great Feast was proclaimed by the Lyon at his Court, and how the Wolf and his Wife and the Hound, Complain'd against <hi>Reynard</hi> the Fox, and the Event of the same.</head>
               <p>IT was when the VVoods were clothed with the green Attire, and the Meadows adorned with delicate and fragrant Flowers, with the Birds sweetly Chanting forth their harmonious Songs in the entrance of delicate Spring. The Lyon the King of Beasts, intending to celebrate the Feast of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> in great State and Ceremony, and keeping open Court in his Palace of <hi>Sanden.</hi> He sent forth his Royal Proclamation over his Kingdoms, to all the Beasts whatever, upon pain of Contempt, to resort to Celebrate this great Beast, vvithout delay.</p>
               <p>Now when this King had assembled his Court, there vvere fevv Beasts found, but made their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint against the Fox, especially <hi>Isegrim</hi> the Wolf, vvho made the first Complaint, having his Friends and Kindred with him standing before the King, said, Most dread Soveraign Lord the King, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech, according to your great Povver you vvould take pity on me and my Wife for the great Injures I have suffered by that false Creature <hi>Reynard</hi> the Fox shall it please you, this <hi>Reynard</hi> came into my House and by violence, against the will of my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37769:3"/> Wife, where finding my Children lying in a quiet Couch, he bepist them in so rank a manner, that they became instantly Blind; for which Shame and Villany he hath done me and my Wife I cannot suffer it unregarded, expecting from him Amends, and from your Majesty Iustice.</p>
               <p>When the Wolf had spoken these Words, there stept forth a little Hound called <hi>Curtise,</hi> who made a grievous Complaint unto the King against the Fox, saying, in the extreme cold Season of the Winter, when the Frost was most violent, he had been kept from all manner of Prey, so that he was half Starved, and having but one poor Pudding left, he the said <hi>Reynard</hi> took it unjustly from him. The Hound had hardly uttered these Words, but up starts <hi>Tibert</hi> the Cat, and falling before the King, said, my Lord the King, I must confess that <hi>Reynard</hi> the Fox is much complained against, yet each of these will find enough for his own Clearing, for concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Curtise</hi> the Hound, the Offence was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted long since, the Pudding was mine, though I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained not, for I got it out of a Mill by Night, when the Miller lay asleep. Vpon these words of the Cat, stept forth the <hi>Panther,</hi> and said it was just and good to Complain against <hi>Reynard</hi> for that all the World knew he was a Thief, Murderer, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher, and was false to every Creature; I shall tell you what I saw him do yesterday to <hi>Kaward</hi> the Hare that standeth in the King's Presence, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him he would teach him to sing <hi>Credo,</hi> and make him a good Chaplain, had I not come by, for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37769:3"/> he had got him between his Legs and had caught <hi>Kaward</hi> by the Throat, and had taken away his Life had I not come by and prevented him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O my Lord the King, if you suffer him to go unpunished that hath broken your Peace, your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hereafter will bear the slander of his Evil; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Panther,</hi> said <hi>Isegrim,</hi> you say true.</p>

My Vnkle is a Gentleman and a true Man, and cannot endure falsehood, he doth nothing without the Counsel of a Priest. And since our Lord the King hath made Peace, he never thought hurt to any, he eats but once a day, he chastiseth his Body, weaveth a Shirt of Hair, it is a Year since he eat any Flesh, as I have been informed, he hath forsaken his Castle, a poor Hermitage retains him, he hath distributed his Wealth, and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>THE</hi> next morning went <hi>Bruin</hi> the Bear, to seek <hi>Reynard</hi> the Fox, and coming through a dark Forrest which had a By-path where <hi>Reynard</hi> used when he was hunted, he went over a high mountain where <hi>Reynard</hi> had a Castle called <hi>Malepardus,</hi> where he lay both for Defence and Ease; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Castle he found the Gate shut, which after he had knocked he sate him down on his Tail, and called aloud, Sir <hi>Reynard,</hi> are you at home? I am <hi>Bruin</hi> your Kinsman, come to summon you to Court, to answer several complaints against you, and if you appear not to your Summons, the King hath vowed you shall answer it with your Life; <hi>Reynard</hi> lying close by the Gate, and hearing these words, departed into one of his holes, where he plotted how he might bring the Bear into disgrace, (whom he knevv loved him not,) and also to himself honour; at last he starts out of his hole, and comes forth and said, Dear Vnkle you are very vvelcome, I vvas busie vvhen you spoke, a saying my Evening-Song, Devotion must not be left, I am sorry you have taken this long and painfull Iourney, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had not you come, I had been at Court to morrow on my ovvn accord; for my part I could wish vve vvere both at Court, for since I have left eating flesh, my Body is much distempered and swelled as if it vvould break: alas dear Cosen, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Bear, what meat is it that makes you so

But that which I eat was Hony-combs, full and pleasant; and quoth <hi>Bruin,</hi> do you make so slight of Hony-Combs, that is Meat for the greatest Emperor's Fare? Nephew, help me to some of it and I will be your Friend for ever. Nay quoth the Fox, if you be in earnest, I will bring you where you shall have so much of it as you can devour at a Meal. These words pleased the Bear so that he could hardly stand for laughing: well thought the Fox I will lead him where he shall laugh but on one side of his Mouth; the Fox promised him as much Hony as he could eat, at last he brought him to the House of one <hi>Landferet,</hi> this <hi>Landferet</hi> was a sturdy Carpenter, who had in his Yard a great and masty Oak, in which he had struck two Wedges, so that the cleft stood a great way open, the Fox re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced to see it, so with a smiling countenance, he said, Dear Vnkle be careful, for within this Tree is much Hony, try if you can get it, but eat moderately for a Surfeit is dangerous, for which I would not for a World, you should get. Do not think me such a Fool, said the Bear, but I can eat without hurt, it's true, my best Vnkle, I am too bold; I pray you, said <hi>Reynard</hi> enter the Tree; the Bear with hast entered with his two fore-feet, and thrust his Head into the Cleft quite over his Ears, which as soon as the Fox perceived, he pull'd out the Wedges out of the Tree, so that he locked the Bear fast therein, and finding himself destitute of relief, he howled in a most hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37769:6"/> manner, so that the Carpenter came hastily out of his house, having in his hand a sharp hook; the Fox standing afar off, said to the Bear, is the Hony good Vnkle? you eat, how do you like it, have a care you do not Surfeit? having thus said, he left him and went to his Castle. By this time <hi>Landferet</hi> seeing the Bear fast, went to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and told them that there was a Bear in his Yard fast in a Tree, which when it was known, Men, Women and Children, came with Sticks and Staves, nay the old Beldames came that had never a Tooth in their heads; this great Army put poor <hi>Bruin</hi> in great fear, and hearing a Clamour of the noise, at last rested his head out of the Tree, having left behind him all his Skin and Ears, also after this, the People fell upon the Bear with their Clubs and Staves that they left him almost dead upon the place. At last he made his Escape, bitterly cursing them and the Fox, that brought him to this misery: At last with great Pain and Grief he arrived at the King's Court, where he cried, Behold dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign for doing your Royal pleasure I am brought to this disgrace; then said the King, how durst he do this, I swear by my Crown I will take Revenge which shall make this Traytor tremble.

May it please you, my Father digging in the Ground, found the King's Treasure, which was infinite, he being possest, he grew so proud that he held in scorn all the rest of the Beasts in the Wilderness; at last he caused <hi>Tibert</hi> the Cat to go to <hi>Bruin</hi> the Bear in the Forrest of <hi>Arden</hi> to do him Homage; and promised to set the Crown on <hi>Bruin</hi>'s Head, which he was glad, being very Ambitious; then presently he sent for his Wife, and <hi>Isegrim</hi> the Wolf and <hi>Tibert</hi> the Cat, where it was concluded to murther your Majesty, and to make <hi>Bruin</hi> King, by the assistance of my Father's great Riches; and it hapned that my Nephew <hi>Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi> being Drunk with Wine discovered this damnable Plot to Dame <hi>Slopard</hi> his Wife, charging
